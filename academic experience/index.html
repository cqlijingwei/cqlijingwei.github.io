      <h1 class="page-title">Academic Experience</h1>
      <p class="page-description">I studied Computer Science at University of Macau for one and half year as an undergraduate student. Then I decided to study abroad
      and came to Canada. The first destination I went to is Dalhousie University. I quite enjoy studying there. It is a quiet and peaceful city with
      nice and polite people. The good atmosphere helps me focus on studies and therefore I got good academic achievement. In the winter there, I 
      attempted to apply to transfer to University of Toronto because it is so called "the best university in Canada". In the following summer, I got
      the offer and decided to transfer again. Also during the summer period, I took an online course from MIT called 
      <a href="https://www.getsmarter.com/courses/us/mit-sap-big-data-and-social-analytics-online-short-course">Big data and social analytics</a>.
      From then on, I know the importance of understanding a variety of skills in data and programming fields. After transferring to UofT, I added a
      second major Actuarial Science, which includes knowledge about economics, finance, statistics and mathematics. Then during the first summer at
      UofT, I took another online course from Stanford University called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>. It is a course taught by Professor Andrew Ng who is a well-known
      scientist in Machine and Deep Learning field. In 2018, after two-year study at UofT, I am finally going to finish my undergraduate study and take another step
      forward.
