      <h1 class="page-title">Academic Experience</h1>
      <p class="page-description">I studied Computer Science at University of Macau for one and half year as an undergraduate student. Then I decided to study abroad
      and came to Canada. The first destination I went to is Dalhousie University. I quite enjoy studying there. It is a quiet and peaceful city with
      nice and polite people. The good atmosphere helps me focus on studies and therefore I got good academic achievement. In the winter there, I 
      attempted to apply to transfer to University of Toronto because it is so called "the best university in Canada". In the following summer, I got
      the offer and decided to transfer again. Also during the summer period, I took an online course from MIT called 
      <a href="https://www.getsmarter.com/courses/us/mit-sap-big-data-and-social-analytics-online-short-course">Big data and social analytics</a>.
      From then on, I know the importance of understanding a variety of skills in data and programming fields. After transferring to UofT, I added a
      second major Actuarial Science, which includes knowledge about economics, finance, statistics and mathematics. Then during the first summer at
      UofT, I took another online course from Stanford University called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>. It is a course taught by Professor Andrew Ng who is a well-known
      scientist in Machine and Deep Learning field. In 2018, after two-year study at UofT, I am finally going to finish my undergraduate study and take another step
      forward. Then I pursuited my Master degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, completed my Master of Computer Science degree there in December 2019. 
      After around five years of professional work in several diffenrent companies, I plan to continue my academic and research studies. Since September 2022, I prepared to pursuit my Phd degree
      in Computer Science. I have engaged in some research work in UofT, and my ideal next step after 2025 to continue my academic studies is in California. 
      My focus is primarily in Natural Language Processing, Generative AI, Large Language Model and Reinforcement Learning. However, my final phd direction and thesis might differe from the topics I mentioned above.
