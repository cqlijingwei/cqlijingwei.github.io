		<h1>Jingwei Li CS498: Data Visualization, Summer 2019</h1>
		<h3>
		This visualization is based on two datasets. One is the factor affecting an adult income the most. They are statstics including income grouped by
		job titles, grouped by marital status, grouped by education level and average weekly work hours. Another dataset is ten years' homicides statistics
		in each state of USA. Both datasets were first seen in tableau sample work. And based on that, they have good potential to be formed as visualized
		graphs, though tableau techs and any related libraries are used. Only d3 and required basic languages are used.
		</h3>
		<h3>
		There are in total five scenerios in the webpage. The first four are visualizations based on income distribution in various groups, from four 
		different perspectives. And the last are homicides stats in the United States collected and published by the Washington Post. The visualization
		looks at the individual city level because the data was collected from city police departments. In this scenario visualization, data is analysed
		at the state level.
		</h3>
		<h3>
		In addition, please be patient when the visualizations are being loaded. Some duration variables were set and after finishing, the visualization
		should look well formatted while in the process, there are only frames and texts.
		</h3>
