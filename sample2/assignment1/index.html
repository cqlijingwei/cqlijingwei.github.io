				<h2>DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>
				<a href="#" class="button alt" style="margin-bottom: 50px">Back To Top</a>
				<h3>Purpose of a jitter plot.</h3>

				<p>
					The purpose of a jitter plot is to separate data-sets that occupies the same space. By doing this we get a better view of how much of the data occupies the same space. There is no correlation between the distance of the points on the y-axis.
				</p>

				<h3>The purpose of figure 2-3</h3>
				<p>
					Figure 2-3 from <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802363.do">DAOST</a> - shown below - illustrates two different historams visualizing the same (relatively small) dataset.
				</p>

				<img src="/assignment1/images/fig23.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

				<p>
					The purpose of this figure is to show that no two histograms are created equal: When working with small data sets, not only do we need to carefully consider how many bins the histogram is constructed with, but also how the bins are alligned on the x-axis.<br />
					Small data sets are prone to being skewed by bin allignment especially with non-gaussian distribution. The figure caption might as well be <i>how not to histogram.</i>
				</p>

				<h3>When can KDEs be misleading?</h3>

				<p>
					Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) are conceivably better than histograms at representing and retaining the integrity of certain data sets. Handling outliers, lack of bin size / allignement and unabridged representation gives them an advantage over histograms in many cases.
				</p>

				<img src="/assignment1/images/fig24.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

				<p>
					However, KDEs have some disadvantage which can be seen above on figure 2-4. The data, which shows the distribution of US presidents' time-in-office durations, uses two KDE's with different bandwidths on top of the histogram. The issue with this KDE visualization, is that the number of occurences is pracically impossible to read off the graph with a human eye.
				</p>

				<p>
					Small, sparse, discrete and volatile data-sets such as the presidency data are espeically bad for KDE representation and can be very misleading. A peak exists between 40 and 50 months of presidency, however the number of presidents that stayed in office for that duration could be misread to approximately 7, where the true value is 14.
				</p>

				<h3>CDF weaknesses</h3>

				<p>
					Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs) are useful in with other graphs as can be seen below in figure 2-7. The interquartile ranges can easily be estimated using the CDF however statistics such as mean, median and mode are much harder to read of a CDF.
				</p>

				<img src="/assignment1/images/fig27.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

				<h3>Quantile plots.</h3>

				Quantile plots, are essentially x-y inverted CDF plots. They focus more on the quartiles/percentile distribution.

				<h3>Probablity Plots</h3>

				<p>
					A probablity plot is constructed by plotting a supposedly Gaussian distributed data-set transformed through the inverse of the Guassian distribution function which it supposedly follows.
					<br />
					If the data follows the distribution perfectly, we should expect to see a straight line where the gradient is the standard deviation and the zero intercept is mean, Âµ. Any deviations from the Guassian distribution will be clearly visible.
					<br />
					I've personally never seen one before.
				</p>

				<h3>Summary statistics: Mean, median and more.</h3>
				<p>
					Just like anything in life we have to be context-aware - this is especially true in the data visualization. Don't bring a knife to a gunfight and don't use median price of a company's stock to say too much about the company itself.
					<br />
					Similiarly Janert notes that when dealing with symmetric single peak data with few outliers, the mean and standard deviation are useful describers. However, the fewest data sets have all of these properties and therefore these statistics should rarely be used.
					<br />
					On the other hand summary statistics such as median, quantiles and percentiles deal better with noisey and asymetric data and still tell us just as much - if not more - about the distribution. On the downside, they can be quite abstract
					when trying to make assumptions about complicated data-sets.
				</p>

				<h3>Box plots</h3>
				<p>
					A box plot packs median, interquartile ranges, adjacent data points (upper & lower) and - arguably most usefully - outliers. No other plots visualize outliers as explicitly as box plots.
				</p>

				<h3>Violin plots</h3>

				<p>
					The violin chart from <a href="https://blog.modeanalytics.com/violin-plot-examples/">mode analytics</a> shows how the weight of baby chicks depends on different types of feed. The plot is relatively simple considering how much data it actually represents:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Two sexes
						</li>
						<li>
							Six distinct types of feed
						</li>
						<li>
							Continous distributions for each combination of sex and feed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Box plot statistics
						</li>
					</ul>

					<img src="/assignment1/images/figvio.png" alt="" height="75%" width="75%"/>

					<p>
						Box plot statistics are a subset of the data included in violin charts (which can also have a layer of outliers). In this sense they convey more information, which can arguably be considered better. However, more is less and the data shouldn't overwhelm the reader nor distract from the point that is being made.

				<h2>Part 2: DAOST Chapter 3 Questions</h2>
				<a href="#" class="button alt" style="margin-bottom: 50px">Back To Top</a>
				<h3>Figure 3-1 & random noise</h3>

				<p>
					In Janert's own words: <i>"... the data points fall on a relatively smooth curve, and we can have confidence that it represents the data accurately." </i> which can  be paraphrased as data which has no visible outliers and follows a predictable pattern. The data points have very little deviation from the underlying curve, which means little random noise in the positions of the data points.
				</p>

				<h3>Deviating multivariate relationship</h3>
				<p>
					I'm no biologist but I can imagine that the ratio of sex-determining chromosones (XY to XX) in a developing fetus might follow this relationship over time. As male and female fetuses develope the sex is determined - which would then deviate the data set into two groups of ratios.
				</p>

				<h3>Smoothing noisy data</h3>
				<p>
					There's many ways to smooth data. Here, several methods are listed:
				</p>
				<ul type="1">
					<li><b>Weighted splines</b> - sums of higher order polynomial functions</li>
					<li><b>LOESS</b> - approximations via lower order polynomial functions</li>
					<li><b>Moving Average</b> - averaging functions with a set windowsize and averaging parameters (exponential, weighted etc.)</li>
					<li><b>Regression</b> - modeling data after some function (exponential, logarithmic, linear etc.)	</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Residuals</h3>
				<p>The residuals are the difference between the true target values and the approximations. I.e. the error. It is a good idea to plot the residuals to see if the residuals:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Are symmetrically distributed around zero.</li>
					<li>Are free of trend or structure. If there is a trend in the residuals, it suggests that the model fails to capture some information.</li>
					<li>Are normally distributed.</li>
					<li>Have constant variance and a mean around zero.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Figure 3-7 & smooth tube</h3>
				<p>
					The <i>"smooth tube"</i> acts as a confidence interval along the approximation curve. At the same time it illustrates intervals along the curve where the residuals are large.
				</p>

				<h3>Semi-log plots</h3>
				<p>
					When data is generated by varying the x-value along an exponential function, it is inherently best represented on a logarithmic scale. As one of the axes increases exponentially, the data can be hard to read. In the same way that probablity plots represent gaussian distributions as linear correlations, semi-log plots transform the data representation to a linear relationships and make the data more parseable to the human eye.
				</p>

				<p>
					Janert has a great example in which some different mammals' heart rates are graphed against their body mass. The first graph (figure 3-9) is a linear plot in which the data points are initially hard to spot.
				</p>

				<img src="/assignment1/images/fig39.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>
				<p>
					The second plot (figure 3-10) shows the same data set on a semi-log scale where the body mass is plotted logarithmically on the x-axis.
				</p>
				<img src="/assignment1/images/fig310.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>

				<h3>Loglog plots</h3>
				<p>
					Similiarly to semi-log plots - log log plots transform data which is exponential or compressed at the low end for both parameters.
				</p>

				<h3>Banking, the visual system, patterns and potential problems</h3>

				<p>
					Banking is a transformation that is not applied to the data, but to the plots themselves by changing the aspect ratio. The purpose is to make <i>changes</i> and curves more recognizeable. It does this by appealing to humans affinity of proportions of 4 by 3. Problems occur when the banking makes the aspect ratio too skewed, or when the banking makes the plot lose too much detail by shrinking the axes. This is further exemplefied in figure 3-11 and 3-12 in DAOST, with the annual sunspot plot.
				</p>

				<h3>Figure 3-14 & linear fits</h3>
				<p>
					Figure 3-14 in DOAST shows the dangers of relying on linear regression to summarise a plot.
					This shows that x on y is not the same as y on x and in order to get a true estimate of their error we
					have to use the mean squared error. If we do not use these the errors might amount to the same since the might have different negative and
					positive values that cancel each other out.
				</p>

				<h3>Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics</h3>

				<p>
					The discussion of Graphical Analysis and Presentation Graphics is a <i>what</i> vs <i>how</i>. In graphical analysis we try and see what and how much data we can get from various plots and what these really show us. With presentation graphics we try and convey the information in the best way possible so that can directly extrapolate the data by looking at the graph. In this case it is not design over quality but design in quality, meaning our design must assist us in providing easy to understand visualization.

			It is easy to observe that fresh produce peaks in the mid-summer to fall seasons, i.e. July to Oktober.
			What is interesting to observe, is that the storage produce peak inverse to fresh produce.
			Storage produce peaks in the winter while being all time low in the mid-summer to fall.
			This is not surprising, as there is no reason to storage produce in the mid-summer to fall seasons
			when fresh produce is ready to be sold instead.

		The visualization to the right is a scatter plot the Boston Marathon winning times for men and women. The winning times are quantified in minutes.
		The buttons allows filtering between men and women, while the lines are a linear fit of the winning times.
		<br>
		What stands out the most is that men were allowed to compete much earlier than women, hence the men goes back to year 1897
		while women begins around 1968. Secondly, it is clear that men on average are faster than women.
