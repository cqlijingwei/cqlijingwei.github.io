						<h3>What is the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of a narrative?</h3>
						<p>
							As written in the article, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines the word <b>Narrative</b> as:
							<br />
							<i>"An account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them."</i>
							<br /> OED has since made the definition more concise:
							<br /><b>Noun:</b> A spoken or written account of connected events; a story.
						</p>

						<h3>What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.</h3>
						<p>
							Amongst the five selected case studies presented by the authors, two stood out in particular. The <b>White House Budget Forecast</b> which - when compared to true outcome - gives an intruging and debatable insight to the undetering optimism of economists. There could be many interesting reasons for this behavior.
						</p>
						<img src="images/f1.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>
						<p style="color:gray;"><i>Budget Forecasts Visualization extract</i></p>
						<p>
							Even more impressive, is the <b>Human Developement Trends</b> visualization, which - despite its outdated look - conveyed the most information. Without going into too much excruciating detail, the visualization gives plenty of room to explore while traversing a scripted story.
						</p>
						<img src="images/f2.png" alt="" height="100%" width="100%"/>
						<p style="color:gray;"><i>Human Developement Trends extract</i></p>
						<p>
							Through the use of well-selected and evenly distributed examples, the visualization communicates central messages leaving plenty of room to pause, search for similair cases or even counter-examples. The author finds a sweet spot between overburdening the viewer with examples and leaving statistcal conclusions unexplained. Grouping the skillful story telling plot, with this vast data set and the well-crafted visualizations made re-enabling flash player every click worth it.
						</p>
						<h3>What's the point of Figure 7?</h3>
						<p>
							The goal of the entire paper is to <i>systematically review the design [of visualizations].</i> The authors select 58 visualizations from online journals, business articles and viuslazation research papers and examine them in detail. The analysis is expressed in the form of the table shown in figure 7. The table, which is described as a <i>"design space"</i> shows the 58 visualization, where each carries certain charactersistics which it may share with other visualizations.

							<p style="color:gray;"><i>Figure 7</i></p>
							<p>
								The narrative componenets of each visualization are identified and categorized. A visualzation may contain (+) or lack (-) a feature, or the feature may not be applicable (gray).
								<ul>
									<li>One of seven <b>genres</b></li>
									<li>As few as zero but as many as eleven out of sixteen <b>visual narratives</b> which are grouped into three sub-categories</li>
									<li>At least one of seventeen <b>navarrative structures</b>, which are also grouped into three sub-categories</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally four red boxes show patterns which the authors have decided to highlight in the table.
								<ol>
									<li>Narrative formats</li>
									<li>Consistency in interaction design</li>
									<li>Consistent under-utilization of <i>“tacit tutorials”</i> and <i>“stimulating default views”</i></li>
									<li>Under-utilization of common narrative messaging techniques</li>
								</ol>
								With this expansive categorization this table becomes somewhat daunting and overwhelming.
							</p>

							<h3>Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc).</h3>
							<p>
								Although most design features are somewhat correlated with genres, each sub-category has a <i>most prominent feature</i>. They are shown in the table below:
							</p>
							<table style="width:100%">
								<tr>
									<th>Visual Narrative / Narrative Structure</th>
									<th>Most Common Design Feature</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Visual structuring</td>
									<td>Consistent visual platform</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Highlighting</td>
									<td>Feature distinction</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Transition guidance</td>
									<td>Object continuety</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Ordering</td>
									<td>User directed path</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Interactivity</td>
									<td>Very limited interactivity</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Messaging</td>
									<td>Captions headlines</td>
								</tr>

									<h3>What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization?</h3>
									<p>
										Somewhere between an annotated charts and films lays our favorite narrative genre. Namely the <b>slideshow</b>. By telling a clear story chronologically, yet giving the reader the flexibility to stop, contemplate and explore along the way is a <i>best-of-both-worlds</i> kind of visualization.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>What is your least favorite genre?</h3>
									<p>
										Considering the tools and technologies that are available, exploring a data set with a <b>magazine style</b> wall of text is a choice that better have a good reason. With the average attention span dropping through the floor, we'd assume most audiences prefer content that appeals to more than just the text-proccessing part of the brain.
										<br />
										In some cases - where copious background information is required - the wall of text may be the only way out.
