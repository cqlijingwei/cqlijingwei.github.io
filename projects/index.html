      <p class="page-description"> I completed several projects in various fields. It mainly includes five fields: Web Development,
        Full-Stack Development, Machine and Deep Learning, Financial Engineering and Software Development in Java.
          <li>In Dalhousie University, I took several courses about Java including interesting projects such as robot game, sudoku, bank simulation and etc.
        All these projects can be found on my Github webpage.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Web Development: <p>I took an online course called Advancend Technologies for Web-Based System. 
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and php are programming skills involved. I created several webpages and implemented some 
            functions in the constructed system.</p></li>
          <li>Full-Stack Development: <p>I worked with a software developer who previously work for Amazon to build a full-stack project similar to LinkedIn, like a small version of LinkedIn.
        In the project, we build a system including front-end, back-end and database which is full-stack style.</p></li>
          <li>Machine Learning: <p>As is mentioned in my academic experience, I took courses about Machine Learning from both Stanford University and University of Toronto. 
        Prof. Andrew Ng and Prof. Michael Guerzhoy gave several projects out to complete the courses, and I was able to implement Machine Learning skills 
        in the projects. The projects include linear regression, logistic regression training, spam classifier using support vector machine,
        image compress using K-means clustering algorithm, failing networks server detection using anomaly detection algorithm, image classsification,
        digit and face recognition using deep neural network, text classification using Naive Bayes algorithm and Tic-Tac-Toe game strategy-making using 
        Reinforce Learning.</p></li>
          <li>Financial Engineering: <p>For Financial Engineering, I took several courses about financial calculus. Recombing binomial tree model construction,
        fees valuation using Newton-Raphson method, Monte-Carlo model construction using Black-Scholes formula and stochastic process. </p></li>
          <li>Software Development in Java: <p>In Dalhousie University, I took several courses about Java including interesting projects such as robot game, sudoku, bank simulation and etc.
        All these projects can be found on my Github webpage.</p></li>
        </ul>
