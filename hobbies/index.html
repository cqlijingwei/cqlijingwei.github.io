      <p class="page-description">I enjoy playing computer games, watching sports games, listening to music and singing! 
        My favorite basketball team is Houston Rockets, favoriate player is Lebron Jame. My favorite Esports team is RNG from League of Legends. 
        There are two singers I like the most. Leehom Wang, a famous pop musician in China, and Bruno Mars, a famous pop musician in the USA.
	I also like traveling around and experience local culture.
        So far, I have been to Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Halifax in Canada. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phyllodophia, Washington, Boston and New York in the USA.
        In my spare time, I would also take some online courses for knowledge accumulation.
        Apart from what I say, there is a video which can show I am able to sing! It is a singing match I attended when I was in Halifax. It was pretty funny.
